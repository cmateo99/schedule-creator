Title: Work Day Scheduler
This is a web app that allows users to schedule their work day. It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes the Bootstrap and DayJS libraries.
Use:
Open the page to view the Work Day Scheduler. Scroll down to view time blocks for standard business hours. Each time block is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green). Click into a time block to enter an event. Click the save icon for that time block to save the text of the event in local storage. The saved text will be retained in the local storage and will be displayed when the page is refreshed.
